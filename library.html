    <p class="center fancy-border">Every once in a while I will post another Meow file, here are all of them to date:</p>
    <ul>
        <li class="meow-item fancy-border"><span class="meow-title">Meow I:</span> (Waterfox) permanently down</li>
        <li class="meow-item fancy-border"><span class="meow-title">Meow II:</span> Heroic Games launcher (with this you can launch any steam game even windows games on Mac)
            (GOOGLE DRIVE FILE IS NOT WORKING, TRYING TO FIX IT, HEROIC CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM THE INTERNET AT <a target="_blank" href="https://heroicgameslauncher.com/">THIS WEBSITE</a>)
            <ol>How to use it?
            <li>Go <a target="_blank" href="https://steamunlocked.net/">here</a> to download any Steam game for free.</li> 
            <li>Expand the Zip file and then find the .exe file.</li>
            <li>Go to Heroic and press add game, then press select .exe file.</li></ol>
            Multiplayer does not work from steam unlocked.
            Sometimes an error message comes up, usually it still works and you can X out of it.
            <a target="_blank" href="https://itch.io/">itchio</a> has some good off brand games as well, but not all are free. (multiplayer works)
            These websites are both blocked so I would recommend going to them on your personal computer. You can get games from my gamefile library (work in progress).
